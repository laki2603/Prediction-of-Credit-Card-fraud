# ðŸ’³ Credit Card Fraud Detection Flask API

This repository contains a Flask API for credit card fraud detection using a machine learning model. The project includes pre-trained models, data preprocessing, and an API for making predictions. Below, you'll find information on how to use this code for local development, the project structure.

# Local setup
- Used can either download or clone the code
- open command prompt and navigate to the folder where you have stored the downloaded/cloned file open src
- used the command `python app.py`
- the above command will run the app
- use this url after you run tghe app `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
